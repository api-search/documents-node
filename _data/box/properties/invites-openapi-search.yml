        The existing user can not be part of another enterprise and
        must already have a Box account. Once invited, the user will receive an
        email and are prompted to accept the invitation within the
        Box web application.

        This method requires the "Manage An Enterprise" scope enabled for
        the application, which can be enabled within the developer console.
