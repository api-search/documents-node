    The AcccountBrands resource provides methods that allow you to create and delete the account brand associated with an account.

    Branding allows you to add the look and feel of your organization's
    brand to the sending, signing, and email process making it easier for users to identify envelopes coming from your organization.

    The DocuSign Account Custom Branding feature lets you set the colors, logo, and text for your account. You can create any number of brand profiles with different settings to reflect each of your corporate brands or different internal divisions or departments.

    When you create or change a branding profile, it applies to everyone using that profile and affects all envelopes sent with that profile.

    The EnvelopeRecipients resource allows you manage the recipients of an
    envelope. There are seven recipient types. All types share
    a [core set of parameters](#core-recipient-parameters).
    Some recipient types have additional parameters.

    <br>

    | Recipient type | Description |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | [Agents](#agents-recipient) | An agent recipient can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the agent in routing order. |
    | [Carbon Copies](#carbon-copies-recipient) | Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope but don't need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing order. Carbon copy recipients receive their copy of the envelope when the envelope reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the envelope is completed. |
    | [Certified Deliveries](#certified-deliveries-recipient) | Certified delivery recipients must receive the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. However, they don't need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. |
    | [Editors](#editors-recipient) | Editors have the same management and access rights for the envelope as the sender. They can make changes to the envelope as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor. |
    | [In-Person Signers](#in-person-signers-recipient) | An in-person recipient is a DocuSign user, acting as a Signing Host, who is in the same physical location as the signer. |
    | [Intermediaries](#intermediaries-recipient) | An intermediary is a recipient who can, but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order, unless subsequent agents, editors or intermediaries are added. |
    | [Seals](#seal-recipient) | An electronic seal recipient represents a legal person. Electronic seals can be used by organizations and governments to show evidence of origin and integrity of documents. |
    | [Signers](#signers-recipient) | A signer is a recipient who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope. |

    <br>

    Not all recipients are are available to all account types.
    Review your account plan to determine
    which recipient types are available to you.
    All recipient types are available in the Demo environment.


    ## Core Recipient Parameters

    All recipients, regardless of type, have the same common parameters.
    The following table contains the descriptions
    for the core properties for all recipient types.

    <br>

    | Name | Required | Schema Type | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | email | Yes | Email | Email of the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
    | name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
    | accessCode | No | String | This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity.<br/>Maximum Length: 50 characters. |
    | addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient; this nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |
    | clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true**, an error is generated on sending. |
    | embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |
    | customFields | No | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the envelope status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a maximum length of 100 characters. |
    | emailNotification | No | emailNotification | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*: a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000 characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*: The simple type enumeration of the language used. The supported languages, with the language value shown in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia (id), Bahasa Melayu (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN), Chinese Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English US (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), French Canada (fr_CA), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hindi (hi), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian (no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR), Romanian (ro),Russian (ru), Serbian (sr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX), Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian (uk) and Vietnamese (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT**: If this is enabled for one recipient, it overrides the Envelope Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings. Also, you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |
    | excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the envelope to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is set to **true**, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. |
    | idCheckConfigurationName | No | String |Specifies authentication check by name. The names used here must be the same as the authentication type names used by the account (these name can also be found in the web console sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient). This overrides any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/> Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set to `ID Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|
    | iDCheckInformationInput | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex element contains input information related to a recipient ID check. It can include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*: Used to set recipient address information and consists of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*: consists of six elements, with street2 and zipPlus4 being optional. The elements are: street1, street2, city, state, zip, zipPlus4\. The maximum number of characters in each element are: street1/street2 = 150 characters, city = 50 characters, state = 2 characters, and zip/zipPlus4 = 20 characters.<br/><br/>displayLevelCode: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*dobInformationInput*: Used to set recipient date of birth information and consists of:<br/><br/>*dateOfBirth*: Specifies the recipient's date, month and year of birth.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn4InformationInput*: Used to set the last four digits of the recipient's SSN information and consists of:<br/><br/>*ssn4*: Specifies the last four digits of the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn9InformationInput*: Used to set the recipient's SSN information. Note that the ssn9 information can never be returned in the response. The ssn9 input consists of:<br/><br/><br/><br/>*ssn9*: Specifies the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay. |
    | inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration | No | Boolean | Optional element. If true and the envelope recipient creates a DocuSign account after signing, the Manage Account Email Notification settings are used as the default settings for the recipient's account. |
    | note | No | String | A note that is unique to this recipient. This note is sent to the recipient via the signing email. The note displays in the signing UI near the upper left corner of the document on the signing screen.<br/>Maximum Length: 1000 characters. |
    | phoneAuthentication | No | RecipientPhoneAuthentication | Optional element. Contains the elements: <br/><br/> *recipMayProvideNumber*:Boolean. When set to **true** thenrecipient can use whatever phone number they choose to.<br/><br/> *senderProvidedNumbers*: ArrayOfString. A list of phone numbers the recipient can use. <br/><br/>*recordVoicePrint* - Reserved for DocuSign. <br/><br/>*validateRecipProvidedNumber* - Reserved for DocuSign. | |
    | recipientAttachment | No | Attachment | Reserved for DocuSign. |
    | recipientId | No | String | Unique for the recipient. It is used by the tab element to indicate which recipient is to sign the Document. |
    | requireIdLookup | No | Boolean | When set to **true**, the recipient is required to use the specified ID check method (including Phone and SMS authentication) to validate their identity. |
    | roleName | No* | String | Optional element. Specifies the role name associated with the recipient.<br/><br/>This is required when working with template recipients. |
    | routingOrder | Yes | String | This element specifies the routing order of the recipient in the envelope. |

    ## Intermediaries Recipient

    An intermediary is a recipient who can, but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order, unless subsequent agents, editors or intermediaries are added.

    In addition to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters),
    this type adds the following parameters.

    <br>

    | Name | Required | Schema Type | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | canEditRecipientEmails | No | Boolean | Optional element. When set to **true**, the Agents Recipient associated with this Recipient can change the Recipient's pre-populated Email address. This element is only active if enabled for the account. |
    | canEditRecipientNames | No | Boolean | Optional element. When set to **true**, the Agents Recipient associated with this recipient can change the recipient's pre-populated name (`UserName`). This element is only active if enabled for the account. |

    <br>

      "canEditRecipientNames": false
    }],
    ```



    ## Seals Recipient

    An electronic seal recipient is not a natural but a legal person. Electronic Seals can be used by organizations and governments to show evidence of origin and integrity of documents.
    Even though electronic seals can be represented by a tab in a document, they do not require user interaction and apply automatically in the order specified by the sender. The sender is therefore the person authorizing usage of the electronic seal in the flow.
    Electronic seal recipients rely on a subset of core properties. They also add a new `recipientSignatureProviders` parameter.


    <br>


    | Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Required&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Schema Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | recipientId| Yes | String | Indicates the unique ID of the applied electronic seal.<br/>|
    | routingOrder| No (default: 1) | String | Specifies the routing order of the electronic seal in the envelope. <br />The routing order assigned to your electronic seal cannot be shared with another recipient. It is recommended that you set a routing order for your electronic seals.. |
    | recipientSignatureProviders| Yes | String | Indicates which electronic seal to apply on documents when creating an envelope. |

    By default, Electronic Seals apply on all documents in an envelope. However, the sealDocumentsWithTabsOnly property (see recipientSignatureProvider) allows you to seal only documents that have signHere tabs set for the Electronic Seal recipients.

    ## Signers Recipient

    A signer is a recipient who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

    In addition to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters),
    this type adds the following parameters.

    <br>


    | Name | Required | Schema Type | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | autoNavigation | No | Boolean | Specifies whether auto navigation is set for the recipient.|
    | defaultRecipient | No | Boolean | When set to **true**, this is the default recipient for the envelope. This option is used with the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms method. |
    | signInEachLocation | No | Boolean | When set to **true** and the feature is enabled in the sender's account, the signing recipient is required to draw signatures and initials at each signature/initial tab (instead of adopting a signature/initial style or only drawing a signature/initial once). |
    | signatureInfo | No | String | Optional element only used with recipient types In Person Signers and Signers.<br/><br/>Allows the sender to pre-specify the signature name, signature initials, and signature font used in the signature stamp for the recipient. |
    | signerEmail | No | String | Optional element. The email address for an InPersonSigner recipient Type.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
    | signerName | Yes | String | Required element with recipient type In Person Signers.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>The full legal name of a signer for the envelope. |
    | tabs | No | Tab | Optional element only used with recipient types In Person Signers and Signers.<br/><br/>Specifies the Tabs associated with the recipient. See the the [EnvelopeTabs resource][envelopeTabsResource]  for more information about tabs. |

    \ eSignature REST API\nlets you collect payments\nalong with signatures and other\
    \ information.\n\nTo send a request for payment\nand collect payments,\nyou need\
    \ a payment gateway account,\nwhich is the destination for the payments.\nCreate\
    \ a payment account\nwith a supported payment gateway,\nand then connect the payment\
    \ gateway account\nto your DocuSign account.\nTo learn how to connect a payment\
    \ gateway account\nto your DocuSign account\nsee [Managing Payment Gateways][paymentgateways]\n\
    in the DocuSign Support Center.\nYou must connect and manage payment gateway accounts\
    \ manually\nthrough the DocuSign Admin console\nand through your chosen payment\
    \ gateway.\nThere is no public API\nfor connecting payment gateway accounts\n\
    to DocuSign accounts\nor for managing payment gateway accounts.\n\nCurrently\n\
    [Stripe][stripe],\n[Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), and\n[Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/)\n\
    are the supported payment gateways.\n\n### How Payments Work\n\nTo make a request\
    \ for payment,\nuse a [`formulaTab`][formulatab]\nthat has a\n[`paymentDetails`][paymentdetails]\
    \ object.\nThis object includes\na list of [`paymentLineItem`][paymentlineitem]\
    \ objects.\nEach line item refers to a [`number`][numbertab] tab\nthat contains\
    \ the value of the each item.\nThe purpose of the line items\nis to transmit them\
    \ to the payment gateway\nas metadata, so that you can use the information\nin\
    \ the payment processor.\n\n**Note**: If the fileExtension parameter is not added\
    \ in an API call, only base64 converted pdf files will be accepted.\nAny attempt\
    \ to send a non pdf file without using fileExtension results in an error.\n\n\
    This is an example request for two books.\nEach book is specified in the `number`\
    \ tabs\nlabeled \"Hamlet\" and \"Tempest\".\nThe books are referenced as line\
    \ items\nby their tab labels\nwithin the `paymentDetails` object\nof a `formula`\
    \ tab.\nThe formula of the `formula` tab\nadd the values of the same two `number`\
    \ tabs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"documents\": [\n    {\n      \"documentBase64\": \"\

    \n### Some Things to Keep in Mind About Payments\n\n* An envelope is not completed\
    \ until all payments are completed.\n\n* If a DocuSign account Administrator\n\
    \  deletes a payment gateway account connection\n  DocuSign cancels all in-process\
    \ envelopes\n  that reference the deleted payment gateway account.\n\n* If the\
    \ sender voids an envelope,\n  all payment authorizations are canceled.\n\n* If\
    \ a required recipient refuses to sign,\n  all authorized payments are canceled.\n\
    \n* If a required recipient's payment fails authorization,\n  DocuSign attempts\
    \ to recover\n  by sending the recipient\n  notification about the failed payment\
    \ authorization.\n  The recipient has the opportunity\n  to correct the payment\
    \ method information.\n\n* Each recipient's payment is authorized separately.\n\
    \  Accounts are charged and payment made\n  after all required tabs are completed,\n\
    \  and all payments in an envelope for all recipients are authorized.\n\n* Refunds\
    \ are not supported.\n  Conduct refunds or payment changes\n  with the payment\
    \ gateway separately from DocuSign.\n\n* At this time, DocuSign does not charge\
    \ a per-transaction fee.\n\n\n[enveloperecipientslist]: https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/Envelopes/EnvelopeRecipients/list/\n\

    \ and Templates\n\nCustom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates\nby setting\
    \ the `customTabId` property\nwhen creating an envelope or template recipient\n\
    or when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.\nThe custom tab must be added\
    \ as the correct tab type.\nFor example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot\
    \ be used as a number tab.\n\nWhen the `customTabId` property is set,\nthe new\
    \ tab inherits all the custom tab properties.\nRequired information that is not\
    \ included in the custom tab,\nsuch as document ID and page ID, must be included\
    \ when adding the tab.\nIf the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X\
    \ and Y positions must be included.\n\nAfter the tab is created,\nit is treated\
    \ as any other tab for updating or deleting.\n\n## Anchoring Tabs\n\nThe tab anchoring\
    \ option\nallows you to send documents for signature\nthat do not have a fixed\
    \ layout or format.\nIn these documents you might not know\nthe absolute location\
    \ of the tabs\nwhen you design your API client application because the tabs must\
    \ move with text.\nAs an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,\n\
    the DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab\nby correlating\
    \ anchor information to data within the document.\n\nWhen the DocuSign Service\
    \ receives a request that contains tabs\nwith anchor information,\nit searches\
    \ the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.\nWhen found,\nit\
    \ places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.\nTab positions\
    \ are established by setting offsets for the tab.\n\nWhen you apply tabs to the\
    \ document,\nDocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString`\
    \ property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the\
    \ background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes\
    \ and it will not be visible on the document.\n\nTo use an anchoring option:\n\
    \n1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing\
    \ text string or add a new one.\nFor best performance DocuSign recommends using\
    \ single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large\
    \ number of pages in the envelope.\nFor example, you might want to add a Sign\
    \ Here tab to the \"Borrower's Signature\" lines in a document, but that phrase\
    \ might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear.\
    \ In this case, you could add the text \"BorrowerSignHere\" in white font color\
    \ (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here\
    \ tabs to appear and use \"BorrowerSignHere\" as the anchor string.\n1. Reference\
    \ the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.\n1. Determine the\
    \ offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed.\n\n\
    Setting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on\
    \ the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down\
    \ the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.\n\
    For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent\
    \ to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative\
    \ to that.\nFor all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent\
    \ to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to\
    \ that.\nDocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values.\
    \ Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.\n\
    \n### Rules for working with anchor tags\n\nWhen anchor tabs are used, all documents\
    \ in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.\n\n* You set the\
    \ text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are\
    \ created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document,\
    \ so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not\
    \ result in unintentional tabs.\n* You cannot use the same anchored tab for different\
    \ recipients for the same document.\n* The DocuSign system cannot search for text\
    \ that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.\n* X or Y offsets\
    \ supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use\
    \ different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient,\
    \ create multiple, unique anchor tabs.\n* If the Y offset value of an anchor string\
    \ would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page\
    \ boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries,\
    \ the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes\
    \ the X offset that resulted in the error.\n* The system does not support an anchor\
    \ string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.\n* The system\
    \ does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility\
    \ of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential\
    \ width of the ultimate tab value.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\nThe following are\
    \ tips for effective use of anchor tags:\n* In order to avoid unintentional conflicts\
    \ between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally\
    \ exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text\
    \ that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.\n* Develop an extensible\
    \ and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.\n* Especially\
    \ for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source\
    \ document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations.\
    \ Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor\
    \ tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all\
    \ use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.\n\n##\
    \ Automatically Populating Tabs\n\nIf you want similar tab types\nto automatically\
    \ populate with the same data,\nyou must follow these guidelines:\n\n* Each `tabLabel`\
    \ entry must have the characters\n  `\\\\*` in front of the label.\n  If you omit\
    \ the `\\\\*` prefix,\n  only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.\n\n\
    \  When automatically populating tabs,\n  the `tabLabel` must not contain any\
    \ spaces.\n  In the JSON example below,\n  the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName`\
    \ and `StudentFirstName`\n  will be auto-populated as specified (\"Doe\" and \"\
    John\")\n  each place they appear throughout the envelope.\n\n  ```\n  \"tabs\"\
    : {\n    \"textTabs\": [\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentLastName\"\
    ,\n      \"value\": \"Doe\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentFirstName\"\
    ,\n      \"value\": \"John\"\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n* Each occurrence of the tab\
    \ must have identical properties.\n\n  For example, suppose there are two Text\
    \ tabs in a document,\n  each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.\n  If one tab has\
    \ the `bold` property set to **true**,\n  and the other has the `bold` property\
    \ set to **false**,\n  only the first one will be populated.\n  In order to automatically\
    \ populate both occurrences\n  of the `Name` Text tabs,\n  the `bold` property\
    \ must be set to the same value for both tabs.\n"

    \ for the core properties for a recipient.\n\n| Name | Required? | Schema Type\
    \ | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| email | Yes | Email | Email of\
    \ the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum Length:\
    \ 100 characters. |\n| name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum\
    \ Length: 100 characters. |\n| accessCode | No | String | This optional element\
    \ specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity.<br/>Maximum\
    \ Length: 50 characters. |\n| addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional\
    \ attribute indicates that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient;\
    \ this nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |\n| clientUserId\
    \ | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If\
    \ the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Note\
    \ that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount`\
    \ or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true**,\
    \ an error is generated on sending. |\n| embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String\
    \ | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient.\
    \ When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from\
    \ DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the\
    \ email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL\
    \ to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's\
    \ system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token\
    \ to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used\
    \ for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process\
    \ directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign\
    \ system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will\
    \ reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing\
    \ or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important\
    \ to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded\
    \ recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects\
    \ that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
    \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
    \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the\
    \ sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
    \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing\
    \ the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application\
    \ would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign\
    \ authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication,\
    \ etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId`\
    \ property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign\
    \ ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email\
    \ recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property\
    \ using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: templateId, recipientId,\
    \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part\
    \ of the recipient or template. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/\
    \ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |\n| customFields | No\
    \ | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide\
    \ custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the template\
    \ status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have\
    \ a maximum length of 100 characters. |\n| emailNotification | No | emailNotification\
    \ | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for\
    \ the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*:\
    \ a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000\
    \ characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email\
    \ sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*:\
    \ The simple type enumeration of the language used. The supported languages, with\
    \ the language value shown in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia\
    \ (id), Bahasa Melayu (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN),\
    \ Chinese Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English\
    \ US (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French\

    \ (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX), Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian\
    \ (uk) and Vietnamese (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT**: If this is enabled for one\
    \ recipient, it overrides the Template Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings.\
    \ Also, you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |\n\
    | excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that are\
    \ not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account\
    \ and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the template\
    \ to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is set to **true**,\
    \ documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.\
    \ Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries)\
    \ or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see\
    \ all the documents in an template, unless they are specifically excluded using\
    \ this setting when an template is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always\

    \        | Place this tab on the document if you want the recipient to approve\
    \ documents in an envelope without placing a signature or initials on the document.\
    \ If the recipient clicks the Approve tab during the signing process, the recipient\
    \ is considered to have signed the document. No information is shown on the document\
    \ for the approval, but it is recorded as a signature in the envelope history.\
    \ |\n| Checkbox Tab          | Place this tab on the document in a location where\
    \ the recipient can select a yes/no (on/off) type option. |\n| Company Tab   \

    \ is retained. If you need a particular date format enforced, DocuSign recommends\
    \ using a Text tab with a Validation Pattern and Validation Message to enforce\
    \ the format. |\n| Decline Tab           | Place this tab on the document where\
    \ you want to give the recipient the option of declining an envelope. If the recipient\

    \ supporting documents to an envelope. |\n| SSN Tab               | This tab is\
    \ a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers. A Social Security\
    \ Number can be typed with or without dashes. |\n| Text Tab              | This\

    \ title to appear. |\n| Zip Tab               | This tab is a single-line field\
    \ where the recipient can enter numbers. |\n\n\n## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes\
    \ and Templates \n\nCustom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates\nby setting\
    \ the `customTabId` property\nwhen creating an envelope or template recipient\n\
    or when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.\nThe custom tab must be added\
    \ as the correct tab type.\nFor example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot\
    \ be used as a number tab.\n\nWhen the `customTabId` property is set,\nthe new\
    \ tab inherits all the custom tab properties.\nRequired information that is not\
    \ included in the custom tab,\nsuch as document ID and page ID, must be included\
    \ when adding the tab.\nIf the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X\
    \ and Y positions must be included.\n\nAfter the tab is created,\nit is treated\
    \ as any other tab for updating or deleting. \n\n## Anchoring Tabs\n\nThe tab\
    \ anchoring option\nallows you to send documents for signature\nthat do not have\
    \ a fixed layout or format.\nIn these documents you might not know\nthe absolute\
    \ location of the tabs\nwhen you design your API client application because the\
    \ tabs must move with text.\nAs an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates\
    \ for tabs,\nthe DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab\n\
    by correlating anchor information to data within the document.\n\nWhen the DocuSign\
    \ Service receives a request that contains tabs\nwith anchor information,\nit\
    \ searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.\nWhen found,\n\
    it places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.\nTab positions\
    \ are established by setting offsets for the tab.\n\nWhen you apply tabs to the\
    \ document,\nDocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString`\
    \ property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the\
    \ background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes\
    \ and it will not be visible on the document.\n\nTo use an anchoring option:\n\
    \n1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing\
    \ text string or add a new one.\nFor best performance DocuSign recommends using\
    \ single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large\
    \ number of pages in the envelope. \nFor example, you might want to add a Sign\
    \ Here tab to the \"Borrower's Signature\" lines in a document, but that phrase\
    \ might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear.\
    \ In this case, you could add the text \"BorrowerSignHere\" in white font color\
    \ (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here\
    \ tabs to appear and use \"BorrowerSignHere\" as the anchor string. \n1. Reference\
    \ the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.\n1. Determine the\
    \ offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed. \n\
    \nSetting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right\
    \ on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab\
    \ down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.\n\
    For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent\
    \ to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative\
    \ to that.\nFor all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent\
    \ to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to\
    \ that.\nDocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values.\
    \ Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.\n\
    \n### Rules for working with anchor tags\n\nWhen anchor tabs are used, all documents\
    \ in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.\n\n* You set the\
    \ text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are\
    \ created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document,\
    \ so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not\
    \ result in unintentional tabs.\n* You cannot use the same anchored tab for different\
    \ recipients for the same document.\n* The DocuSign system cannot search for text\
    \ that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.\n* X or Y offsets\
    \ supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use\
    \ different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient,\
    \ create multiple, unique anchor tabs.\n* If the Y offset value of an anchor string\
    \ would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page\
    \ boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries,\
    \ the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes\
    \ the X offset that resulted in the error.\n* The system does not support an anchor\
    \ string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.\n* The system\
    \ does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility\
    \ of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential\
    \ width of the ultimate tab value.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\nThe following are\
    \ tips for effective use of anchor tags:\n* In order to avoid unintentional conflicts\
    \ between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally\
    \ exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text\
    \ that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.\n* Develop an extensible\
    \ and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.\n* Especially\
    \ for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source\
    \ document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations.\
    \ Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor\
    \ tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all\
    \ use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.\n\n##\
    \ Automatically Populating Tabs\n\nIf you want similar tab types\nto automatically\
    \ populate with the same data,\nyou must follow these guidelines:\n\n* Each `tabLabel`\
    \ entry must have the characters\n  `\\\\*` in front of the label.\n  If you omit\
    \ the `\\\\*` prefix,\n  only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.\n\n\
    \  When automatically populating tabs,\n  the `tabLabel` must not contain any\
    \ spaces.\n  In the JSON example below,\n  the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName`\
    \ and `StudentFirstName`\n  will be auto-populated as specified (\"Doe\" and \"\
    John\")\n  each place they appear throughout the envelope.\n\n  ```\n  \"tabs\"\
    : {\n    \"textTabs\": [\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentLastName\"\
    ,\n      \"value\": \"Doe\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentFirstName\"\
    ,\n      \"value\": \"John\"\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n* Each occurrence of the tab\
    \ must have identical properties.\n\n  For example, suppose there are two Text\
    \ tabs in a document,\n  each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.\n  If one tab has\
    \ the `bold` property set to **true**,\n  and the other has the `bold` property\
    \ set to **false**,\n  only the first one will be populated.\n  In order to automatically\
    \ populate both occurrences\n  of the `Name` Text tabs,\n  the `bold` property\
    \ must be set to the same value for both tabs.\n"

        Creates a DocuSign Custom Connect definition for your account. DocuSign Connect enables the sending of real-time data updates to external applications. These updates are generated by user transactions as the envelope progresses through actions to completion. The Connect Service provides updated information about the status of these transactions and returns updates that include the actual content of document form fields. Be aware that, these updates might or might not include the document itself. For more information about Connect, see the [ML:DocuSign Connect Service Guide].

        Retrieves a list of envelope custom fields associated with the account. You can use these fields in the envelopes for your account to record information about the envelope, help search for envelopes and track information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.

        There are two types of envelope custom fields, text, and list. A text custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. The list custom field lets the sender select the value of the field from a list you provide.

      summary: Gets status changes for one or more envelopes.
      description: "Retrieves a list of envelopes that match your request. \nA large\
        \ set of optional filters let you filter\nby date,\nby envelope ID,\nor by\
        \ status codes.\n\nYour request must include one or more of the following\
        \ parameters:\n\n* `from_date`\n* `envelope_ids`\n* `transaction_ids`\n\n\n\
        Getting envelope status using `transaction_ids` is useful\nfor offline signing\
        \ situations where it can be used\ndetermine if an envelope was created or\
        \ not. It can be used\nfor the cases where a network connection was lost,\
        \ before\nthe envelope status could be returned.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary database\
        \ queries, the DocuSign\nsignature platform first checks requests to ensure\
        \ that the\nfilter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response\n\
        before querying the database. \n\nFor example, for a request with a `from_to_status`\
        \ of\n`delivered` and a current `status` of `created,sent`,\nDocuSign will\
        \ always return an empty list. \nThis is because the request translates to:\
        \ find the\nenvelopes that were delivered between the `from_date` and\n`to_date`\
        \ dates that have a current status of `created` or\n`sent`. Since an envelope\
        \ that has been delivered can\nnever have a status of `created` or `sent`,\
        \ a zero-size\nresponse would be generated. \nIn this case, DocuSign does\
        \ not query the database\nand returns an empty list immediately.\n\n\nThe\
        \ following table shows the valid current envelope\nstatuses (`status` parameter)\
        \ for the different status\nqualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the\
        \ request. If\nthe status and status qualifiers in the API request do not\n\
        contain any of the values shown in the Valid Current\nStatuses column, then\
        \ an empty list is returned.\n\nClient applications should check that the\
        \ statuses (`status`\nparameter) they are requesting make sense for a given\n\
        `from_to_status` parameter value.\n\n| Status Qualifier<br>(`from_to_status`)\
        \ | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                  \

      summary: Creates an envelope.
      description: |
        Creates and sends an envelope or creates a draft envelope.
        Envelopes are fundamental resources in the DocuSign platform.

        With this method you can:

        * Create and send an envelope
          with [documents][], [recipients][], and [tabs][].
        * Create and send an envelope from a template.
        * Create and send an envelope from
          a combination of documents and templates.
        * Create a draft envelope.


        When you use this method
        to create and send an envelope
        in a single request,
        the following parameters in the request body (an [`envelopeDefinition`][envelopeDefinition]) are required:

        | Parameter      | Description |
        | :--------      | :---------- |
        | `status`       | Set to `sent` to send the envelope to recipients.<br>Set to `created` (or don't set at all) to save the envelope as a draft. |
        | `emailSubject` | The subject of the email used to send the envelope. |
        | `documents`    | The [documents][] to be signed. |
        | `recipients`   | The email addresses of the envelope [recipients][]. |


        There are many ways to use envelopes.
        You can create and send an envelope
        with a single API request,
        or you can use several API requests
        to create, populate, and send envelopes.

        **Note**: When you create an envelope by using a [composite template](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/concepts/templates#composite-templates), you should specify the envelope custom fields in the inline template. Any custom fields that you specify at the root level are ignored.

          For some documents, one or more signatures must be witnessed by an appointed [notary public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public).

          DocuSign supports eNotary services for many jurisdictions. This example demonstrates how to send an envelope to be signed by Susan Signer with her signature witnessed by Nancy Notary. You must know the name and email address of the signer and the notary public for a signature to be notarized.

          Note that the full legal name of the signer must be used. It will be checked against the signer's government-issued proof of identity by the notary public.

          Please see the [DocuSign eNotary resource page](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-enotary-resources) for further information. It lists the jurisdictions participating in the DocuSign eNotary program and additional reference information.

          Note that eNotary services are not included with all account types and are **not** included by default with demo/developer sandbox accounts. To enable eNotary service for your sandbox account, contact your DocuSign technical support person or DocuSign customer service.

          The example includes event notification via the Connect service.

      - description: |
          DocuSign enables document signers use
          [electronic](https://www.docusign.com/products/electronic-signature) or
          [digital](https://www.docusign.com/how-it-works/electronic-signature/digital-signature) signatures.

          DocuSign has tightly integrated standard digital signatures into the DocuSign Signature platform. This enables a single envelope to include:

          * electronic signatures,
          * AES digital signatures using certificates from DocuSign or from your organization,
          * QES digital signatures from government certified Trust Service Providers (TSPs).

          This example enables the signer to create an eIDAS compliant AES signature with embedded signing. InPerson signers can also use SBS digital signatures.

          [More information on creating SBS digital signature requests.](../../../../guide/appendix/standards_based_signatures.html)

          The `clientId` in the example tells DocuSign that the Signing Ceremony will be embedded.
          The example also includes an `eventNotification` object for receiving envelope status updates from DocuSign.

          ## Embedding the signing ceremony
          1. Send the `Envelopes: create` call as shown below in the Request/Response section.
          2. The response will include the `envelopeId`
          3. Use the [EnvelopeViews: createRecipient](../../EnvelopeViews/createRecipient) request to obtain the redirectURL as follows:

          `POST /v2/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/views/recipient`

          ````
          {
              "clientUserId": "1000",
              "email": "Sam@spade.com",
              "userName": "Sam Spade",
              "returnUrl": "https://your_app.example.com",
              "AuthenticationMethod": "Password"
          }
          ````
          The response will include the `url`. Redirect the user's browser to the url to start the signing ceremony.

          ###### Note: You must **immediately** redirect the user to the url you receive from DocuSign. The url is only valid for 5 minutes. Don't request a recipient view url until you are ready to redirect the user's browser.

        ### Important: The BCC Email address feature is designed to provide a copy of all email communications for external archiving purposes. DocuSign recommends that envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature, including the BCC Email Override option, include additional signer authentication options. To send a copy of the envelope to a recipient who does not need to sign, use a Carbon Copy or Certified Delivery recipient type.

        \ is using a mobile or tablet. \n\nThis method is only used with envelopes\
        \ in the `sent` status.\n\nYour application is responsible for authenticating\
        \ the identity of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the\
        \ parameters `assertionId`, `authenticationInstant`, `authenticationMethod`,\
        \ `clientUserId`, and `securityDomain` to record information on how the recipient\
        \ was authenticated. At a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId`\
        \ are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope's\
        \ certificate of completion.\n\n## The event status parameter\nAfter the signer\
        \ completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user's\
        \ browser back to your app via the `returnUrl` that you supply. DocuSIgn appends\
        \ an `event` query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony.\
        \ Your app should use the event parameter to determine the next step for the\
        \ envelope. Don't fetch the envelope's status via Envelopes: get or a similar\
        \ method; that could break the DocuSign rule against polling.\n\n## The URL\
        \ is time-limited\nThe URL returned by this method is valid for one use. It\
        \ must be used/displayed within a couple of minutes after being generated.\
        \ Once the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact\
        \ with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.\n\n\
        Because the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent via email.\
        \ Immediately redirect the user's browser to the URL after you receive it.\n\
        \nIf you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email,\
        \ the email invitation's URL must be to your application. When invoked, your\
        \ app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the\
        \ signer to that URL.\n\n## Maintaining State\nAfter the recipient completes\
        \ the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application.\
        \ Your application can recover state information about the transaction by\
        \ storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the\
        \ `returnUrl` field. Eg, `https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState=12345`\
        \ When the user is redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will\
        \ be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a guessable\
        \ value as the state value."

        Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group. You can associate a group with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions for users in that group without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user. You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but it makes it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. You can also use groups with template sharing to limit user access to templates.

        This sets the shared access status for one or more users or templates.

        When setting template shared access, only users who own a template and have sharing permission or with account administration privileges can set shared access for templates.

        Changes to the shared items status are not additive. The change always replaces the current status.

        To change template shared access the query parameter `item_type` =  `templates` must be added to the request. When this is set, the user and envelopes properties are not required.

        ### Template Email Subject Merge Fields

        Call this endpoint to insert a recipient name and email address merge fields into the email subject line when creating or sending from a template.

        The merge fields, based on the recipient's role name, are added to the `emailSubject` property when the template is created or when the template is used to create an envelope. After a template sender adds the name and email information for the recipient and sends the envelope, the recipient information is automatically merged into the appropriate fields in the email subject line.

        Both the sender and the recipients will see the information in the email subject line for any emails associated with the template. This provides an easy way for senders to organize their envelope emails without having to open an envelope to check the recipient.


        ###### If merging the recipient information into the subject line causes the subject line to exceed 100 characters, then any characters over the 100 character limit are not included in the subject line. For cases where the recipient name or email is expected to be long, you should consider placing the merge field at the start of the email subject.

        To add a recipient's name in the subject line add the following text in the `emailSubject` property when creating the template or when sending an envelope from a template:

        `[[<roleName>_UserName]]`

        Example:

        `"emailSubject":"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this NDA",`

        To add a recipient's email address in the subject line add the following text in the `emailSubject` property when creating the template or when sending an envelope from a template:

        `[[<roleName>_Email]]`

        Example:

        `"emailSubject":"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA",`


        In both cases the <roleName> is the recipient's contents of the `roleName` property in the template.

        For cases where another recipient (such as an Agent, Editor, or Intermediary recipient) is entering the name and email information for the recipient included in the email subject, then `[[<roleName>_UserName]]` or `[[<roleName>_Email]]` is shown in the email subject.

        The body of this request
        is an array
        of [`Users`][usersobject] objects.
        For each new user,
        you must provide at least
        the `userName`
        and
        an `email`.

        The
        [`userSettings` property](#user-settings)
        is a [name/value][nameValue]
        list that specifies the actions users can
        perform.
        In the example below,
        Tal Mason

        ###### Note: Custom user settings are not the same as user account settings.

        ###Getting Grouped Custom User Settings###

        If the custom user settings you want to retrieve are grouped, you must include the following information in the header, after Content-Type, in the request:

        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`

        Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of customer user settings.

        If the extra header information is not included, only the custom user settings that were added without a group are retrieved.

        ###### Note: Custom user settings are not the same as user account settings.

        Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve custom user information that you can use in your own system.

        **Important**: There is a limit on the size for all the custom user settings for a single user. The limit is 4,000 characters, which includes the XML and JSON structure for the settings.

        ### Grouping Custom User Settings ###

        You can group custom user settings when adding them. Grouping allows you to retrieve settings that are in a specific group, instead of retrieving all the user custom settings.

        To group custom user settings, add the following information in the header, after Content-Type:

        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`

        Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of customer user settings. Grouping is shown in the Example Request Body below.

        When getting or deleting grouped custom user settings, you must include the extra header information.

        Grouping custom user settings is not required and if the extra header information is not included, the custom user settings are added normally and can be retrieved or deleted without including the additional header.

        filename\" value that is used to map to the `signatureName` and/or `signatureInitials`\
        \ properties in the JSON to the image. \n\nFor example: \n`Content-Disposition:\

        Enables or disables API request logging for troubleshooting.

        When enabled (`apiRequestLogging` is set to true), REST API requests and responses for the user are added to a log. A log can have up to 50 requests/responses and the current number of log entries can be determined by getting the settings. Logging is automatically disabled when the log limit of 50 is reached.

        You can call [ML:GetRequestLog] or [ML:GetRequestLogs] to download the log files (individually or as a zip file). Call [ML:DeleteRequestLogs] to clear the log by deleting current entries.

        Private information, such as passwords and integrator key information, which is normally located in the call header is omitted from the request/response log.

        ###### Note: API request logging only captures requests from the authenticated user. Any call that does not authenticate the user and resolve a userId isn't logged. Meaning that login_information, NewAccounts, or other distributor-credential calls are not logged.

      summary: Gets login information for a specified user.
      description: |
        Retrieves account information for the authenticated user. Since the API is sessionless, this method does not actually log you in.
        Instead, the method returns information about the account or accounts that the authenticated user has access to.

        ###### Important: This method must only be used for the [Legacy Header Authentication](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/legacy) flow. Use the [`AccountServer: userInfo` method](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/user-info-endpoints) for the OAuth2 Authentication Code and [Implicit Grant flows](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-implicit).

        Each account has a `baseUrl` property, returned in the response.
        Use this `baseUrl` in all future API calls as the base of the request URL.

        For each account, the `baseUrl` property includes the DocuSign server, the API version, and the `accountId` property.

        It is not uncommon for an authenticated user to have access to more than one account (and more than one `baseUrl`). Depending on your integration's use case, your integration may choose to:

        * Use the account whose `isDefault` field is `true`.
        * List the available accounts and ask the user to choose one.
        * Enable the system administrator to set the account that should be used by your integration.

        If this method returns successfully, then you also know that the user has successfully authenticated with the DocuSign Signature platform.

        For more information on Authentication Login, please see our [REST API Authentication Guides](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication).

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

            The information used in the bulk recipient file header must be the same as the `tabLabel` for the tab.

            The values entered in this column are automatically inserted into the corresponding tab for the recipient in the same row.

            Note that this option cannot be used for tabs that do not have data or that are automatically populated data such as Signature, Full Name, Email Address, Company, Title, and Date Signed tabs.

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\

        entered in any format. The tooltip for this tab recommends
        entering the date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced.

        particular date format enforced, DocuSign recommends using a
        Text tab with a validation pattern and a validation message
        to enforce the format.

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\

            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\

            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\

            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\

            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\

            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\

            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\

            Contains the formula
            for calculating the value of
            this tab.

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ that is launched by any partner.\n\nIt is important to remember that\
            \ in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient\
            \ is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that\
            \ senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's\
            \ identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId,\
            \ recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

- name: Envelopes
  summary: Creating and sending envelopes
  description: |+
    The DocuSign API Envelope category includes the resources and methods for sending and managing envelopes and envelope data.

    Envelopes are the key objects within the DocuSign eSignature system. As a result, they are complex data structures with few required fields. See the [API Recipes](https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/recipes) for use case examples and their solutions.

    To create and send envelopes, see the [Envelopes resource](Envelopes).

- name: Connect
  summary: Connect configuration and logging
  description: "The Connect category enables your application to be called via HTTPS\
    \ when an event of interest occurs.\n\nUse the Connect service to \"end the polling\
    \ madness.\" With Connect, there is no need for your application to poll DocuSign\
    \ every 15 minutes to learn the latest about your envelopes.\n\nInstead, you register\
    \ your interest in one or more types of envelope or recipient events. Then, when\
    \ an interesting event occurs, the DocuSign platform will contact your application\
    \ with the event's details and data. You can register interest in envelopes sent\
    \ by particular users in your account, or for envelopes sent by any user.\n\n\
    ## Incoming Connect Calls\nTo use the Connect service, your application needs\
    \ to provide an https url that can be called from the public internet. If your\
    \ application runs on a server behind your organization's firewall, then you will\
    \ need to create a \"pinhole\" in the firewall to allow the incoming Connect calls\
    \ from DocuSign to reach your application. Other techniques for receiving the\
    \ incoming calls including proxy servers and DMZ networking can also be used.\
    \ \n\n## Per-envelope Connect Configuration\nInstead of registering a general\
    \ Connect configuration and listener, an individual envelope can have its own\
    \ Connect configuration. See the `eventNotification` field for envelopes.\n\n\
    ## Categories\nUse the Connect category for:\n\n* Programmatically creating Connect\
    \ configurations. Connect configurations can be created manually by using the\
    \ DocuSign web service, or programmatically via the API. Configurations created\
    \ via the API can be seen and updated from the web service.\n* Retrieving and\
    \ managing the event log for your Connect configurations. \n* Requesting that\
    \ an event be re-published to the listener."
